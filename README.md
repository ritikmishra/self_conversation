# `self_conversation`

A React app to talk to yourself in an instant-message format

## How it works

- Messages to yourself are stored with a timestamp in the browser's IndexedDB
  - The usage of IndexedDB means that it won't work in environments where it is not available, such as Firefox Private Mode
- Messages alternate between left/right
